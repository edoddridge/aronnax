# Aronnax

An idealised isopycnal ocean circulation model that can either be run
as a reduced gravity model with n + 1/2 layers, or with n layers and
variable bathymetry.

Aronnax is
- [Easy to install](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  on a laptop or a compute node, including without
  administrative privileges.
- Easy to configure.  All parameters, including grid size, are
  specified at runtime in a simple configuration file.
- [Easy to use](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).
  Aronnax can be controlled programmatically as a Python library.
- Easy to learn and understand, with extensive [online
  documentation](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), including a
  complete description of [the
  physics](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aronnax_model.html#the-physics)
  and [the
  numerics](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aronnax_model.html#numerical-algorithm).
- [Verified](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verification.html).
  Aronnax successfully [reproduces published results](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#reproducing-published-results) from
  idealised models appearing in the literature.
- [Fast](http://aronnax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html).  The
  main integration loop is a Fortran program, wrapped in
  Python for convenient use.
