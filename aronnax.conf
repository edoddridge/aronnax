# au is the lateral friction coefficient in m^2 / s
# ah is thickness diffusivity in m^2 / s
# ar is linear drag between layers in 1/s
# dt is time step in seconds
# slip is free-slip (=0), no-slip (=1), or partial slip (something in between)
# nTimeSteps: number of timesteps before stopping
# dumpFreq: time between snapshot outputs in seconds
# avFreq: time between averaged output in seconds
# hmin: minimum layer thickness allowed by model (for stability) in metres
# maxits: maximum iterations for the pressure solver algorithm. Should probably
#   be at least max(nx,ny), and possibly nx*ny
# eps: convergence tolerance for pressure solver. Algorithm stops when error is 
#   less than eps*initial_error
# freesurfFac: 1. = linear implicit free surface, 0. = rigid lid.
# botDrag is the linear bottom friction in 1/s
# thickness_error is the  discrepancy between the summed layer thicknesses and 
#   the depth above which the model emits a warning. 1e-2 is a 1% discrepancy.
# debug_level controls the level of output produced by the model. When set to
#   zero, or not specified (it defaults to zero), the model outputs h, u, and v
#   at the frequency controlled by dumpFreq and avFreq. Specifying larger
#   integer values results in progressively more output more frequently. See
#   the documentation for details.

# RedGrav selects whether to use n+1/2 layer physics (RedGrav=yes), or n-layer 
#   physics with an ocean floor (RedGrav=no)
# depthFile defines the depth of the ocean bottom below the sea surface in metres.
# hmean is a list of initial thicknesses for the layers in metres. Each value is 
#   separated by a comma. This input was a useful short cut for specifying 
#   initial conditions with constant layer thicknesses, but has been superseded 
#   and may be removed in the future.
# H0 is the depth of the ocean basin and is only required in n-layer mode. This 
#   input was a useful short cut for specifying a flat bottomed ocean, but has

# g_vec is the reduced gravity at interfaces in m/s^2. g_vec must have as many
