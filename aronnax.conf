# au is the lateral friction coefficient in m^2 / s
# ar is linear drag between layers in 1/s
# kh is thickness diffusivity in m^2 / s
# kv is vertical thickness diffusivity in m^2/s
# dt is time step in seconds
# slip is free-slip (=0), no-slip (=1), or partial slip (something in between)
# niter0: the timestep at which the simulation begins. If not zero, then there 
#   must be checkpoint files in the 'checkpoints' directory.
# n_time_steps: number of timesteps before stopping
# dump_freq: time between snapshot outputs in seconds
# av_freq: time between averaged output in seconds
# checkpiontFreq: time between checkpoints in seconds 
#   (these are used for restarting simulations)
# diag_freq: time between dumping layerwise diagnostics of the simulation. These
#   are mean, min, max, and std of h, u, and v in each layer.
# hmin: minimum layer thickness allowed by model (for stability) in metres
# maxits: maximum iterations for the pressure solver algorithm. Should probably
#   be at least max(nx,ny), and possibly nx*ny
# eps: convergence tolerance for pressure solver. Algorithm stops when error is 
#   less than eps*initial_error
# freesurf_fac: 1. = linear implicit free surface, 0. = rigid lid.
# bot_drag is the linear bottom friction in 1/s
# thickness_error is the  discrepancy between the summed layer thicknesses and 
#   the depth above which the model emits a warning. 1e-2 is a 1% discrepancy.
# debug_level controls the level of output produced by the model. When set to
#   zero, or not specified (it defaults to zero), the model outputs h, u, and v
#   at the frequency controlled by dump_freq and av_freq. Specifying larger
#   integer values results in progressively more output more frequently. See
#   the documentation for details.
# h_advec_scheme selects which advection scheme to use when advecting the
#   thickness field. Current options are:
#   1 first-order centered differencing
#   2 first-order upwind differencing
# ts_algorithm selects the time stepping algorithm used by the model
#   3 (default) is third-order Adams-Bashfort

# red_grav selects whether to use n+1/2 layer physics (red_grav=yes), or n-layer
