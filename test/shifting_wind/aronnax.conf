# Aronnax configuration file. Change the values, but not the names.
# 
# au is viscosity
# kh is thickness diffusivity
# ar is linear drag between layers
# dt is time step
# slip is free-slip (=0), no-slip (=1), or partial slip (something in between)
# n_time_steps: number of timesteps before stopping
# dump_freq: frequency of snapshot output
# av_freq: frequency of averaged output
# hmin: minimum layer thickness allowed by model (for stability)
# maxits: maximum iterations for the successive over relaxation algorithm. Should be at least max(nx,ny), and probably nx*ny
# eps: convergence tolerance for SOR solver
# freesurf_fac: 1. = linear implicit free surface, 0. = rigid lid. So far all tests using freesurf_fac = 1. have failed 
# g is the gravity at interfaces (including surface). must have as many entries as there are layers
# input files are where to look for the various inputs
