! Parameter file. Change the values, but not the names.
! 
! Each namelist ends with a /
! This is important and should not be deleted.
!
! au is viscosity
! ah is thickness diffusivity
! ar is linear drag between layers
! dt is time step
! slip is free-slip (=0), no-slip (=1), or partial slip (something in between)
! nTimeSteps: number of timesteps before stopping
! dumpFreq: frequency of snapshot output
! avFreq: frequency of averaged output
! hmin: minimum layer thickness allowed by model (for stability)
! maxits: maximum iterations for the successive over relaxation algorithm. Should be at least max(nx,ny), and probably nx*ny
! eps: convergence tolerance for SOR solver
! freesurfFac: 1. = linear implicit free surface, 0. = rigid lid. So far all tests using freesurfFac = 1. have failed 
! g is the gravity at interfaces (including surface). must have as many entries as there are layers
! input files are where to look for the various inputs
